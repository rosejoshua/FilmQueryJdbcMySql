## Film Query Project

### Description

This is a simple console-based Java application that retrieves and displays film data from a SQL database. It is menu-based, allowing the user to choose actions and submit query data. Emphasis was placed on using proper OOP principles of design.

### Topics and Technologies Used

* JDBC
* SQL
* MySQL
* bind variables
* Maven
* OOP
* I/O filereader
* ArrayLists
* switch statement
* interfaces
* method overrides

### How to Run

Download all appropriate class files, compile java application and run DatabaseAccessor. You will need a MySQL database in order to use full functionality. Follow menu prompts.

### Lessons Learned

I had some trouble figuring out the syntax for passing wildcard search arguments given the subtle differences in Java and MySQL commands when setting bind variables. Most other errors were mainly due to erroneous commas or improper copy-pasting of code. This was a very enjoyable project and I look forward to growing my knowledge in the Java Database Connectivity API.
